The GYM-GURU application allows users to easily find a personal trainer and order a workout plan with a diet. The application enables registered personal trainers to search for meals by name using the Edamam API service. Trainers can also use the Wger exercise database and modify their added plans. The API of the backend application is secured by a JWT token and all passwords in the database are encrypted. The application repository is controlled by CircleCI. The frontend of the application is available after launching the Java Vaadin frontend project at http://localhost:8081/gymguru/. </p>
